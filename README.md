# gen-schotter

Lately, I've been looking for an excuse to start learning creative coding, so I thought it would be interesting to recreate in p5.js some artworks from the pioneers of computer-generated art. My first attempt was Georg Nees' 'Schotter', a composition featuring a grid of squares that are slightly rotated and displaced, creating a mesmerizing sense of randomness and balancing order and chaos:

I started with what I knew—Grasshopper Python—so I built a definition there to get the basics going and eventually transitioned to the unfamiliar world of p5.js:

To add some interactivity, I incorporated sliders that allow users to adjust the number of columns, rows, rotation, and displacement ratios:

I also created a slider that controls the location of the 'chaos' within the composition:

Here are a few animations I made while experimenting with the different variables:

Finally, I used a 3D printer as a pen-plotter to produce a couple of small prints:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26198366/229350430-e32d98a5-6416-4143-ac87-1d2fa55ed320.png)
